# TI-BASIC-Pong-Implementation
A version of Pong that can be run on a TI-84 graphing calculator.  
For best experience, set the window to around x: 0-40 and y: 0-20. 
The up and down arrow keys are used to direct the (green) player controlled stick. The red stick is automatically operated.
The ball gets slightly faster as the game progresses. 
The first side to five points wins.
